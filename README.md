# Apple-Quest (My NCEA Programming Assessment)

This program was supposed to be made in python but I like rust (the programming language not the game)

## About
This is a questionare game with the questions being about Apple Inc.
This questionare will consist of 5 multichoice questions about Apple.

The user will answer from 1-4 on which they think is the right answer. 
After doing all the questions the program will show the user how many points they got in total.

The user is also prompted at the end if they want to play again.

## Installing and Playing

First [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you dont have it already

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cbhs-digitech/Apple-Quest.git
```

Enter the repository and enter this
```
cargo run
```
To run the questionare

Have fun with it for 5 minutes

## FAQ
"Please tell us the answer to the question if we get it wrong" - Average tester

To that I say no because it ruins the repeatability of the program
