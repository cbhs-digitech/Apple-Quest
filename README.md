# Apple-Quest (My NCEA Programming Assessment)

This program was supposed to be made in python but I like rust (the programming language not the game)

## About
This is a questionare game with the questions being about Apple Computers. This questionare will consist of 5 multichoice questions about Apple.

The user will answer from 1-4 on which they think is the right answer. 
After doing all the questions the program will show the user how many points they got.

## Installing and Playing

First [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you dont have it already

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cbhs-digitech/as91883---programming-assessment-Dwogo.git
```

Enter the repository and enter this
```
cargo run
```
to run the questionare

Have fun with it for 5 minutes

## FAQ
"Please tell us the answer to the question if we get it wrong" - Average tester

To that I say no because it ruins the repeatability of the program
